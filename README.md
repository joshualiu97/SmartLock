SmartLock is a travel tool that keeps your suitcase safe. The lock itself is a solenoid lock, controlled by a Raspberry Pi with many features. These features inculde a facial recognition functionality with a Pi Camera, a gyroscope for movement detection, and an LED status indicator. When the gyroscope detects unwarrented movement, it sends a signal to your cell phone to let the owner know that the suitcase is currently being moved.
